## Static Analysis
1. Static analysis tools are software tools that analyze the source code of a program without executing it. 
2. They can help developers find and fix errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, and other quality issues in their code.
3. Static analysis tools can also measure various metrics of the code, such as complexity, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and documentation.
4. Static analysis tools can be integrated into the development process as part of the code editor, the
version control system, or the continuous integration pipeline.
5. static analysis tools are SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, and Pylint.

## pylint
1. Pylint is a code analyzer: Pylint checks your code for errors, style issues, and other potential problems. It can help ensure that your code is reliable, maintainable, and consistent.
2. Pylint uses a variety of metrics: Pylint checks for things like code complexity, unused variables, and bad practices. It can also enforce coding standards, such as using consistent naming conventions.
3. Pylint is highly configurable: Pylint allows you to configure its behavior through a configuration file or command line options. You can customize which metrics it checks, how it reports errors, and more.
4. Pylint integrates with many development tools: Pylint can be integrated with many text editors and IDEs, such as VSCode and PyCharm. It can also be integrated into continuous integration workflows, such as with Travis CI.
5. Pylint is open source: Pylint is an open source tool and is maintained by a community of developers. This means that anyone can contribute to its development or report issues.
